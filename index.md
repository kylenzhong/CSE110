## Intro

I focus on building systems more so than defining goals. I focus on problem-solving more so than product building. I focus on coaching more so than managing.

I am an organized and effective manager of my time and attention. I rely heavily on habits and systems, and use them to streamline the challenging and sometimes tedious journey towards each goal.

As an **engineer**, my favorite social pastime is solving escape rooms with my friends. I get instant gratification every time I help piece together information to unlock the next mystery. When the timer stops, I would either walk out the unlocked room knowing that no puzzle maker could box us in with a maze, or feeling challenged and eager to solve more puzzles in the future to be even.

As an aspiring **Product Manager**, I prioritize the personal growth for each of my team members on the same level as the objectives of a given project. I enjoy going to escape rooms with different groups, each time adapting to the new dynamics. I search for possible ways to fully engage each member with tasks that interest them and challenge them so slightly with tasks that they did not think they could accomplish.

## Inspiration
I am inspired by the works of Steve Jobs, and my favorite quote from him is:
>Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish

Life Motto Summerized in Code:
```
while(isHunry and isFoolish):
  feelAlive()
  keepLearning()

return "A Life Well Lived"
```
